<p>En este post se explica las principales funcionalidades del paquete {eurostat}, que sirve para importar información de dicho organismo. Eurostat es la Oficina de Estadística de la Comisión Europea.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="introducción" class="section level1">
<h1>Introducción</h1>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Eurostat es la Oficina de Estadística de la Comisión Europea</strong>, organismo que se encarga de producir datos, publicar estadísticas e indicadores sobre la Unión Europea promoviendo la armonización de los métodos estadísticos entre los Estados que la conforman. La función de este organismo es fundamental para realizar análisis y comparaciones entre países y entre regiones de la zona euro.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>El paquete {eurostat} consiste en un conjunto de herramientas que tiene como finalidad facilitar la descarga de información desde la base de datos de Eurostat. Los autores de este paquete son Leo Lahti, Janne Huovari, Markus Kainu y Przemyslaw Biecek, quienes han puesto a disposición del público información que facilita su utilización y el aprendizaje de sus funcionalidades (véase el <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-019/RJ-2017-019.pdf">artículo</a> en R Journal, el <a href="http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/articles/eurostat_tutorial.html">tutorial/ vignette</a>, el <a href="http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/articles/cheatsheet.html">cheatsheet del paquete</a>, la documentación sobre sus <a href="http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/reference/index.html">funcionalidades</a> o el <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eurostat/eurostat.pdf">documento</a> de CRAN.r-project ).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>La información de la presente entrada difícilmente podrá superar e incluso complementar a la disponible en los enlaces mencionados. No obstante cabe señalar que este post no pretende tener un carácter divulgativo sino que más bien nace con un objetivo de índole personal, en tanto en cuanto espero que sirva principalmente como proceso para familiarizarme con la utilización de dicho paquete. Dicho esto, si este post sirve de apoyo o ayuda a alguna persona interesada en aprender la utilización del paquete {eurostat} pues bienvenido sea.</p>

<h1>El paquete eurostat</h1>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Como siempre, en primer lugar <strong>cargamos los paquetes</strong> necesarios. Evidentemente cargamos el paquete {eurostat} y, adicionalmente, cargamos el paquete {tidyverse} cuyas funcionalidades se ajustan muy bien con el paquete {eurostat}.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
library(eurostat)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Las <strong>funciones</strong> disponibles del paquete {eurostat} se pueden encontrar en el <a href="http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/reference/index.html">link</a> previamente mencionado o indicando la siguiente orden:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
library(help= &quot;eurostat&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Para <strong>ver el contenido</strong> (table of contents - TOC) del paquete podemos utilizar la función <code>get_eurostat_toc()</code>. Esta función nos da como resultado un tibble de 9863 observaciones y 8 variables (esta información se puede consultar en el siguiente <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?sort=1&amp;file=table_of_contents_en.txt">archivo de texto</a>). A modo de ejemplo seleccionamos las primeras diez observaciones del dataset.</p>

<p>El dataframe contiene información del consumo según frecuencia (cada día, menos de una vez al mes, etc.), de sexo (femenino, masculino o total), por rangos de edad, por ciudadanía y por país. Para consultar el nombre completo de las variables del data set podemos utilizar la función <code>label_eurostat_vars(names())</code> y para comprobar las distintas categorías de las observaciones podemos examinar los levels como se expone a continuación. De esta forma podemos tener una imagen más adecuada del dataset sobre el que estamos trabajando:</p>

<h2>4. ¿Cuál es la proporción de población de entre 15 y 24 años por país que consumen alcohol cada semana?</h2>
<p>Por último examinamos la población, pero en esta ocasión seleccionamos la <strong>población con una edad comprendida entre los 15 y los 24 años</strong>, que consumen alcohol <strong>cada semana</strong>. Para ello realizamos los cambios necesarios como se indica a continuación</p>
